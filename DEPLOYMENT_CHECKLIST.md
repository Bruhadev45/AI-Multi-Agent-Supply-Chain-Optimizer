9. [ ] Test the deployed application
10. [ ] Share your Space URL!

## Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# 1. Clone your new Space
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
cd YOUR_SPACE_NAME

# 2. Copy files (from your project directory)
cp -r /path/to/AI-Multi-Agent-Supply-Chain-Optimizer/* .
cp /path/to/AI-Multi-Agent-Supply-Chain-Optimizer/.dockerignore .

# 3. Rename README
mv README_HUGGINGFACE.md README.md

# 4. Add environment variables via Hugging Face web interface
# (Go to Settings > Variables and secrets)

# 5. Push to deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment"
git push
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Space shows "Running" status
- [ ] Homepage loads successfully
- [ ] Can select cities from dropdowns
- [ ] Can choose scenarios
- [ ] "Run Analysis" button works
- [ ] Results display correctly
- [ ] Export functionality works
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works

## Troubleshooting Quick Checks

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check Space Status**: Should show "Running" not "Error"
2. **Review Build Logs**: Available in your Space's "Logs" section
3. **Verify API Keys**: Check they're added as Secrets (not Variables)
4. **Check Browser Console**: For frontend errors
5. **Test Backend Health**: Visit `/health` endpoint
